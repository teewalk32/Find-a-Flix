# Find-a-Flix


## Description

As a group we were highly motivated to complete this project because this is our first Full-Stack MERN appliction we have ever created. We built this project because we wanted to build an application for the user to search and find Movies and shows to watch, add to a watch list and be directed to a website where the user can view the movie. This appliction will help users find new entertainment, keep track of movies they want to watch by adding to watch list, view movie previews, see movie ratings, and make it easier for them to watch them to find the movie. Building this website helped us learn more about MERN, React, new dependices, and teamwork.
